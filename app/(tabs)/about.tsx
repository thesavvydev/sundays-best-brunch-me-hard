          From the resort-style atmosphere, to the chef-crafted, all day brunch
          menu, you'll feel like you've been transported to an ocean side oasis,
          right in the heart of Sandy, UT. Sunday's Best is that sun shining,
          birds chirping, champagne popping, kind of place. So, let's tell the
          DJ to turn it up, grab some inventive cocktails, fresh oysters on the
          rocks, and see where the vibes take us. There's only one mandate here
          at Sunday's Best, everyone must be prepared to #BrunchHard.
